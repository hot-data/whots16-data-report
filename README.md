## Acknowledgements

>Many people participated in the WHOTS mooring deployment/recovery cruises. They
are listed in Table 1 and and Table 4. We gratefully acknowledge their
contributions and support. Thanks are due to all the personnel of
the [Upper Ocean Processes Group (UOP)](http://uop.whoi.edu) at WHOI who
prepared the WHOTS buoy’s instrumentation and mooring; to Kelsey Maloney, Tully
Rohrer, Noah Howins, Ryan Tabata, and James Harris  for their technical
assistance with the moored and shipboard instrumentation; We gratefully 
acknowledge the support from the colleagues at Sea-Bird to maintain the quality 
of the CTD data. We would also like to thank the captains and crew of the Ship 
Oscar Sette, and the University of Hawaii (UH) Marine Center staff for their 
efforts. The WHOTS mooring work is funded in part by the Ocean Observing and 
Monitoring Division, Climate Program Office (FundRef number xxxxxxxx), 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 
under grant NA14OAR4320158 to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. 
This work was also supported by the National Science Foundation grant xxxxxxxx.

In 2003, Robert Weller (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution [WHOI]), Albert
Plueddemann (WHOI), and Roger Lukas (the University of Hawaii [UH]) proposed to
establish a long-term surface mooring at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT)
Station ALOHA (22°45’N, 158°W) to provide sustained, high-quality air-sea
fluxes and the associated upper ocean response as a coordinated part of the HOT
program, and as an element of the global array of ocean reference stations
supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA)
Office of Climate Observation. The WHOTS-16 mooring was deployed on
October 6, 2019, during an eight-day cruise (WHOTS-16 cruise) and was recovered
on August 28, 2021, during an eight-day cruise (WHOTS-17 cruise). The cruises
were aboard the NOAA Oscar Sette. The seventeenth mooring was deployed on
August 26, 2021, during the WHOTS-17 cruise and was recovered on July 25, 2022.
This report documents and describes the oceanographic observations made on the
WHOTS-16 mooring for nearly one year and ten months and from shipboard
measurements during the two cruises when the mooring was deployed and
recovered. Sections II and III include a detailed description of the cruises
and the mooring, respectively. Sampling and processing procedures of the
hydrographic casts, thermosalinograph, and shipboard ADCP data collected during
these cruises are described in Section IV . Section V includes the processing
procedures for the data collected by the moored instruments: SeaCATs,
MicroCATs, Moored ADCPs and VMCM. Plots of the resulting data and preliminary
analysis are presented in Section VI.
