# Description of WHOTS-16 Mooring

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 

The WHOTS-15 mooring, deployed on September 23rd, 2018, from NOAA’s Ship Hi’ialakai, was outfitted with two complete 
sets of ASIMET sensors on the buoy and underneath subsurface instruments from 7 to 155 m depth and near the bottom. 
See (Santiago-Mandujano et al., 2019)for a complete description of the buoy. The WHOTS-15 recovery on October 8th, 2019,
resulted in about 380 days on station. 

The buoy tower also contains a radar reflector, two marine lanterns, and Iridium 
satellite transmission systems that provide continuous buoy position monitoring. A Xeos Melo Global Positioning System
(GPS) receiver, an SBE-39 temperature sensor adapted to measure air temperature, and a Vaisala WXT-520 multi-variable 
(temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, and precipitation) were also mounted on the tower. A fourth positioning system 
(Xeos Sable transmitter) was mounted beneath the hull. Several other instruments were mounted on the buoy. A Battelle 
pCO2 system, a pumped SBE-16 CTD, and a SAMI-2 pH sensor were mounted to the buoy's underside. 
A Sea-Bird SBE-63 hosted a dissolved oxygen sensor. Three down-looking radiometers were mounted on the
buoy. One hyperspectral sensor is mounted facing upward near the radiometers as a reference for the incoming spectral
irradiance. A Wetlabs ECOFLNTUS chlorophyll fluorometer was also mounted on the buoy hull. 

Five internally-logging Sea-Bird SBE-56 temperature sensors were bolted to the buoy hull's underside, measuring sea 
surface temperature (SST) and salinity. The SBE-56s measured SST once every 60 sec between 80-110 cm below the surface, 
and two SBE-37 MicroCATs were at 1.52 m (see Table III-2).

Instrumentation provided by UH for the WHOTS-15 mooring included 18 SBE-37 Microcats,and two TRDI Workhorse ADCPs, 
transmitting in 300 kHz and 600 kHz, respectively. The Microcats all measured temperature and conductivity, with eleven 
of them measuring pressure. All MicroCATs were deployed with antifoulant capsules. In addition to the buoy instrumentation,
WHOI provided two Vector Measuring Current Meters (VMCMs), two deep Microcats (SBE-37) installed near the bottom of the
mooring, and all required subsurface mooring hardware.

Table III-1 provides a listing of the WHOTS-15 subsurface instrumentation at their nominal depths on the mooring, 
along with serial numbers, sampling rates, and other pertinent information. A cold water spike was induced to the UH 
MicroCATs before deployment (Table III-1) and after recovery Table III-4 by placing an ice pack in contact with their 
temperature sensor to check for any drift in their internal clock. To produce a spike in the ADCP data, each instrument’s 
transducer was rubbed gently by hand for 20 seconds (Table III-3 Table III-5).

The RDI 300 kHz Workhorse Sentinel ADCP, SN 7637, was deployed at 125 m with transducers facing upwards with an additional 
external battery pack. This instrument was set to ping at 4-second intervals for 160 seconds every 10 minutes, and the 
burst sampling was designed to minimize aliasing by occasional large ocean swell orbital motions. The bin size was set 
for 4 m. The total number of ensemble records was 55,176. The first ensemble was on 09/22/2018 at 00:00:00Z, and the 
last was on 10/10/2019 at 03:49.59Z (see Table III-3, Table III-5, and Section VIII.A for more configuration). 
This instrument also measured temperature. 

The RDI 600 kHz Workhorse Sentinel ADCP, SN 13917, was deployed at 47.5 m with transducers facing upwards with an 
additional external battery pack. The instrument was set to ping at 2-second intervals for 160 seconds every 10 minutes, 
and the burst sampling was designed to minimize aliasing by occasional large ocean swell orbital motions. The bin size 
was set for 2 m. The total number of ensemble records was 5,987. The first ensemble was on 09/22/2018 at 00:00:00Z, and 
the last was on 11/02/2018 at 13:39:59Z (see Table III-3, Table III-5, and Section 0 for more configuration). This 
instrument also measured temperature.

The two VMCMs, SN 009 and 010, were deployed at 10 m and 30 m depth. 
The instruments were prepared for deployment by the WHOI/UOP group and set to sample at 2-minutes and 1- minute intervals, 
respectively. These instruments also measured temperature.

All WHOTS-15 instruments were successfully recovered; recovery information for the C-T instruments is shown in
Table III-4. Most of the instruments had some degree of biofouling, with the most substantial fouling near the surface.
The fouling extended down to the ADCP at 125 m, although it was minor at that level.


All MicroCATs were in good condition after recovery. MicroCAT 3382 (15 m) had a bent in its sensor guard. Instrument SN
4663 (25m) had barnacles blocking the top of its conductivity cell, and instruments SN 3668 (45m) and 3620 (55m) had
barnacles attached at the bottom and top end of their conductivity cells, respectively, partially blocking the flow.
The data from all instruments were downloaded onboard the ship, and all instruments returned full data records.
A post-cruise evaluation showed no missing samples in all the MicroCATs and the 300 kHz ADCP, except for the 600 kHz
ADCP that failed before the recovery. Table III-4 has an initial evaluation of the data quality; more details are in
Section V.A, and Section VI.C.

The data from the upward-looking 300 kHz ADCP at 125m were considered good. The instrument was pinging upon recovery. 
There appeared to be no questionable data from this ADCP at this time, apart from near-surface side-lobe interference. 
On the other hand, the 600 kHz instrument was recovered with a depleted battery, and it was not pinging. No apparent 
flooding or rust was detected inside the instrument’s cage. The data recorder indicated that it stopped functioning on 
November 2nd, 2018.
