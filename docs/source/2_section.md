:class: warning

The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Upper Ocean Processes Group (WHOI/UOP)
, with the UH group's assistance, conducted the fifteenth deployment of the
WHOTS mooring onboard the NOAA Ship Hi’ialakai during the WHOTS-15 cruise
between September 21st and September 29th, 2018. The WHOTS-15 mooring was
deployed at Station 50 on September 23rd, 2018, 01:17 UTC at 22° 45.94 'N, 157°
53.70 'W, and the WHOTS-14 mooring were recovered on September 27th. The
scientific personnel that participated during the cruise are listed in Table II
1.

```{warning}
add Table II 1.Scientific personnel on Ship Hi’ialakai during the WHOTS-15 deployment cruise.

The UH group conducted the shipboard oceanographic observations during the
cruise.

A Sea-Bird CTD (conductivity, temperature, and depth) system was used to
measure T, S, and O2 profiles during CTD casts. The time, location, and maximum
CTD pressure for each profile are listed in Table II 2. Twelve CTD casts were
conducted during the WHOTS-15 cruise. CTD profile data were collected at
Station 52 (near the WHOTS-14 buoy) and Station 50 (near the WHOTS-15 buoy). A
test cast was conducted at Station 20 (21°29.06’N 158°22.04’W) offshore of
Makaha, HI, to an approximate depth of 1500 m to test three acoustic releases.
Six CTD yo-yo casts were conducted to obtain profiles for comparison with
subsurface instruments on the WHOTS-15 mooring after deployment, and five yo-yo
casts were performed for comparison with the WHOTS-14 mooring before recovery.
These casts were started less than 0.5 nm from the buoys with varying drift
during each cast and consisted of 5 up-down cycles between near the surface and
200 m.

Also, continuous ADCP and near-surface thermosalinograph data were obtained
while underway.

The NOAA Ship Hi’ialakai was equipped with an RD Instruments Ocean Surveyor 75
kHz ADCP, set to function in broadband and narrowband configurations. The
configuration information is shown in Table II 3. The ADCP used input from an
S.G. Brown gyrometer and a Furuno GP 90 GPS receiver to establish the ship's
heading and attitude. At the same time, an Applanix POSMV4 system archived
attitude data for use in post-processing.

A complete description of these operations is available in the WHOTS-15 cruise
report (Santiago-Mandujano et al., 2019).

Near-surface temperature and salinity data during the WHOTS-15 cruise were
acquired from the thermosalinograph (TSG)
system installed on the NOAA Ship Hi’ialakai. The sensors were sampling water
from the continuous seawater system running through the ship. They were
comprised of one thermosalinograph model SBE-21 (SN 3155) and a
micro-thermosalinograph model SBE-45 (SN 4540403-0150), both with (internal)
temperature and conductivity sensors located in the ship’s wet lab, about 67 m
from separate hull intakes; and an SBE-38 (SN 215) external temperature sensor
located at the entrance to one of the water intakes. The SBE-21 recorded data
every 6 seconds, and the other two instruments recorded data every second. The
water intake for the SBE-21 and SBE-38 is located at the ship's bow, next to
the starboard side bow thruster at a depth of 2 m. The intake for the SBE-45 is
situated near the middle of the ship, also 2 m deep. The system has a pressure
gauge showing a flow pressure of about ten psi during the cruise. Each
thermosalinograph system had a debubbler.

Both thermosalinographs exhibited several conductivity and temperature
glitches, especially the SBE-21. The temperature differences between the
internal SBE-45 and SBE-21 were between 0.4 and 0.8 °C. However, the computed
salinity differences between these two instruments were between -0.03 and 0.03
g/kg. A diurnal cycle is apparent in the temperature and conductivity.

## WHOTS-17 Cruise: WHOTS-16 Mooring Recovery


````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning

The WHOI/UOP Group conducted the mooring turnaround operations during the
WHOTS-16 cruise between October 4th and 12th, 2019. The WHOTS-16 mooring was
deployed at Station 52 on October 6th, 2019, 02:12 UTC at 22° 40.096 'N, 157°
56.788 'W, and the WHOTS-15 mooring was recovered on October 8th, 2019. The
scientific personnel that participated during the cruise are listed in Table II
4.

The UH group conducted the shipboard oceanographic observations during the
cruise. A complete description of these operations is available in the WHOTS-16
cruise report [http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/whots/proc_reports/WHOTS-16_CruiseRpt.pdf].

A Sea-Bird CTD system was used to measure T, S, and O2 profiles during CTD
casts. The time, location, and maximum CTD pressure for each profile are listed
in Table II 5. Eleven CTD casts were conducted during the WHOTS-16 cruise, from
September 21st through 28th, 2019. CTD profile data were collected at Station
20 (in transit to the WHOTS mooring), Station 50 (near the WHOTS-15 buoy), and
Station 52 (near the WHOTS-16 buoy). The cast at Station 20 was 1500 m deep,
and three acoustic releases (two to be used in the WHOTS-16 mooring and one
backup) were attached to the rosette frame for function testing. Five CTD yoyo
casts were conducted to obtain profiles for comparison with subsurface
instruments on the WHOTS-16 mooring after deployment. Five yo-yo casts were
performed for comparison with the WHOTS-15 mooring before recovery. These casts
were started about 0.25 nm from the buoys with varying drift during each cast
and consisted of 5 up-down cycles between near the surface and 204 to 218 m.

Water samples were taken from all casts; 3 to 4 samples for each of them. These
samples were to be analyzed for salinity at UH and used to calibrate the CTD
conductivity sensors

Also, continuous ADCP and near-surface thermosalinograph data were obtained
while underway.

The NOAA Ship Oscar Sette was equipped with a TRDI Ocean Surveyor 75 kHz ADCP,
set to function in broadband and narrowband configurations. The configuration
information is shown in Table II 6. The ADCP used input from a SAMOS gyrometer
and Furuno GP 150, a GPS receiver, to establish the ship's heading and
attitude.

Near-surface temperature and salinity data during the WHOTS-16 cruise were
acquired from the thermosalinograph (TSG)
system installed on the NOAA Ship Oscar Sette. The sensors were sampling water
from the continuous seawater system running through the ship. They were
comprised of one thermosalinograph model SBE-21 (SN 3168) and a
micro-thermosalinograph odel SBE-45 (SN 0290), both with (internal) temperature
and conductivity sensors located in the ship’s chemistry lab, about 70 m from
the hull intake; and an SBE-38 (SN 266) external temperature sensor located at
the entrance of the water intake. All instruments recorded data every second.
The water intake is located at the ship's bow, forward from the starboard side
bow thruster at a depth of 3 m. The system has a flow meter in the chemistry
lab, showing a flow rate of about 1.1 liters/minute during the cruise. Only the
SBE-45 has a debubbler. Salinity water samples were taken every 8 hours from
the exhaust in the Chemistry lab using 0.25-liter glass bottles, to be measured
in the UH lab to correct any drift in the thermosalinograph conductivities.
