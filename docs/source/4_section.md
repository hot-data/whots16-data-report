# WHOTS (16-15) Cruise Shipboard Observations

```{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning

The hydrographic profile observations made during the WHOTS cruises were
obtained with a Sea-Bird CTD package with dual temperature, salinity, and
oxygen sensors. This CTD was installed on a rosette-sampler with 5 L Niskin
sampling bottles for calibration water samples. Furthermore, the Hiâ€™ialakai and
Oscar Sette came equipped with a thermosalinograph system that provided a
continuous depiction of the near-surface layer's temperature and salinity.
Horizontal currents over the depth range of 30-700 m were measured from the
shipboard 75 kHz Ocean Surveyor
(OS75) ADCP (narrowband) with a vertical resolution of 16m for the WHOTS-15 and
WHOTS-16 cruises. Broadband mode for the OS75 provided additional current data
over the range upper 200 m with a vertical resolution of 8m.

Data gaps occurred when the system was shut down temporarily during
communications with the acoustic releases used for the moorings during both
cruises. Periods of missing data between 300 and 450 m in the broadband ADCP
were apparent due to the lack of scattering material in the water.

## Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Profiling

```{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning

Continuous measurements of temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and
pressure were made with the UH Sea-Bird SBE-9/11Plus CTD underwater unit #91361
(BETA), deck unit 112060 during WHOTS-15 and WHOTS-16 cruises. The CTD was
equipped with an internal Digiquartz pressure sensor and pairs of external
temperature, conductivity, and oxygen sensors.

Each temperature-conductivity sensor pair used a Sea-Bird TC duct, which
circulated seawater through independent pump and plumbing installations. The
CTD configuration also included two oxygen sensors, installed in the plumbing
for each sensor set. In both cruises, the CTD was mounted in a vertical
position in the lower part of a rosette sampler, with the sensors' water
intakes located at the bottom of the rosette.
