# Moored Instrument Observations

## MicroCAT-SeaCAT Data Processing Procedures

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning
Each moored MicroCAT temperature, conductivity, and pressure (when installed)
was calibrated at Sea-Bird before their deployment and after their recovery on
the dates shown in Table V 1. The internally-recorded data from each instrument
were downloaded onboard the ship after the mooring recovery. The
nominally-calibrated data were plotted for a visual assessment of the data
quality. The data processing included checking the internal clock data against
external event times, pressure sensor drifts correction, temperature sensor
stability, and conductivity calibration against CTD data from casts conducted
near the mooring during HOT and WHOTS cruises. The detailed processing
procedures are described in this section.
